00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:05.828
Halo?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.719
Hope? Hope Adler? Who is this?

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.659
Alpine Lake?

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:20.955
It's a youth camp in the mountains.

00:01:30.363 --> 00:01:31.963
I... I had a dream.

00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:34.817
Seven digits.

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:38.659
No area code, so it's a local call.

00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:41.259
You're in Colorado, right?

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:47.477
The numbers are carved into the ice.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:52.742
Ya. Ya.

00:01:55.987 --> 00:02:00.309
Who is this? Who are you?

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:06.575
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.402
Halo?

Finney

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:02.170
Please.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.459
Please, stop, please. Are you done?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.926
Don't ever come near me.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.135
Is there anything else?

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:30.848
Hey

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:33.740
What the heck is that?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.339
The new kid.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:37.339
Are you beating up the new kid now?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.420
He started it.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.860
What is it this time?

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.400
A bit strange.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.887
I heard you're the hotshot who took down a serial killer.

00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:47.208
You don't look tough.

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:48.452
He didn't really say that.

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:51.255
Yes, he did say that.

00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:53.979
Do you have to be that harsh with him?

00:04:54.402 --> 00:04:58.505
In such a situation, the more blood the better.

00:04:58.594 --> 00:05:01.288
For the audience, it's more powerful.

00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:03.288
You've shown that many times.

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:05.819
So maybe, I'm just guessing,

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.439
that's not what you really mean,

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:10.398
but more like don't bother me anymore, I'm the one you should be afraid of.

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:12.636
Hei, Gwen.

00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:13.277
Finn.

00:05:13.302 --> 00:05:14.954
Great fight, bro.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.374
Thank you, Ernesto.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.135
Hey, Ernie.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.759
Tonight I'm going to the Civic Center

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.275
entrance ticket Duran Duran.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.300
Duran Duran Tickets?

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.554
You just said that.

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.819
Simon LeBlanc is so cool.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.400
Are you coming, Gwen?

00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.463
If only I could.

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:32.300
The tickets are very expensive.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.040
Let me treat you, I really want to buy two.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.199
It's nice to have friends who are fellow fans.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.028
Seriously?

00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:41.053
Seriously.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.774
That would be cool.

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:44.206
Just consider it done.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.785
Okay, I have to go to craft class. See you later.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.411
You know it's a date. No. Yes, it's a date.

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.545
Okay, so if it's a date, why?

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:06.864
I don't know. I just don't like him. I don't understand why. He's so nice.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.002
Besides, didn't Robin want you to look after her little sister?

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:14.019
But that doesn't mean letting him sleep with my sister.

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:15.809
Don't be dirty, Jizzmopper.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600
Welcome back to Night Flight.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.800
Here's German band Fex with their new hit, Subways of Your Mind.

00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:31.732
Night, Son. Go to sleep!

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:35.133
Okay. Don't stay up late.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.512
Yes, of course.

00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:37.886
If you touch me, I will scratch your face

00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:45.052
This face?

00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:56.910
Hey.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:07.075
Still not my taste.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.204
Don't tell Dad.

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:10.471
Get lost, slapdick.

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:12.004
I'm not a complainer.

00:08:14.483 --> 00:08:16.483
Are you alright?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.695
I'm fine.

00:08:19.962 --> 00:08:24.221
No, I mean... I don't want to talk about it.

00:08:28.805 --> 00:08:31.045
It's okay if you feel that way.

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:35.464
You don't know what I feel.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.191
No, but... I know whatever you feel.

00:08:41.379 --> 00:08:42.977
It's okay. I don't know. So

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:56.453
ALPINE LAKE YOUTH CAMP

00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:29.658

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:33.057
Gwen, Wake Up!

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.606
Why are you so cold?

00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:38.391
Ben?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.663
It doesn't matter.

00:11:42.157 --> 00:11:43.686
You're walking while you sleep again.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.329
Oh my God.

00:11:46.354 --> 00:11:47.872
Your skin is like ice.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.930
I had a nightmare.

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:55.492
It doesn't matter.

00:11:55.517 --> 00:11:57.537
Just go back to sleep.

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:59.522
I said I had a nightmare.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.494
I heard.

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.830
Just go back to sleep.

Hey, witch.

00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:24.653
Hei, Gwen. Hei, Ernie.

00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:27.212
Look at this.

00:12:28.087 --> 00:12:29.886
Cool. I can't believe it.

00:12:31.657 --> 00:12:35.660
So, you like mystical things, huh?

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:41.507
What? You mean ghosts? Spirits? Parallel worlds?

00:12:42.987 --> 00:12:43.748
Yes.

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:45.879
Okay. Yes.

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:47.679
I believe in all those mystical things.

00:12:50.185 --> 00:12:51.159
Cool.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.960
I brought something else.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.200
Ernesto, are you in Latria?

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.379
Yes.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.120
My grandmother sells them in her shop.

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:06.000
I think this is cool. It's like tarot.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
This is beautiful.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I mean, you can use it like tarot.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
If you have a vision, this could show you something.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And you have that, right?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
What do you have?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I mean, you have dreams and stuff.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And that... that shows something?

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.162
Where did you hear that?

00:13:29.338 --> 00:13:31.000
From my parents.

00:13:31.783 --> 00:13:34.983
In the past, he said the police received anonymous calls.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.996
who said where Robin's body was.

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:42.000
But they said it was you.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.700
You said you... dreamed about it.

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.059
Or something like that.

00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:49.730
I don't like to talk about that.

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:52.807
Why?

00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:55.703
Because it's weird.

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.303
I'm weird.

00:13:58.214 --> 00:14:00.992
Maybe I like weird things

It's a youth camp in the mountains.

00:18:18.393 --> 00:18:20.835
How did you get this number?

00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:23.731
I... I had a dream.

00:18:24.784 --> 00:18:26.224
Seven digits.

You're in Colorado, right?

00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:33.167
Yes.

00:18:35.725 --> 00:18:37.699
The numbers are carved into the ice.

00:18:38.707 --> 00:18:40.321
By children.

00:18:40.346 --> 00:18:42.302
Underwater.

00:18:42.327 --> 00:18:43.640
Yes.

00:18:44.066 --> 00:18:47.824
I had the same dream, but the children were carving letters.

00:18:48.646 --> 00:18:49.824
Who are you?

00:18:50.824 --> 00:18:52.000

00:18:54.143 --> 00:18:55.953
Halo?

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:58.641
I said my name was Gwen.

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:00.685
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:19:12.883 --> 00:19:15.601
You shouldn't be here.

00:19:44.703 --> 00:19:48.380
Hei, Quinn.

00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:49.303
Quinn.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.868
Am I really here?

00:19:57.104 --> 00:19:58.424
Are you alright.

00:19:58.977 --> 00:20:01.733
You're sleepwalking again. You came here in your sleep.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.675
I heard you leave and I followed you.

00:20:06.354 --> 00:20:08.079
I feel crazy.

00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:09.019
What the hell?

00:20:09.044 --> 00:20:10.786
Hey, hey, look at me. What the heck?

00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:11.967
You're fine, you're fine.

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:17.675
I'm on the phone.

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:21.236
Finn.

00:20:22.626 --> 00:20:24.730
I talked to Mom.

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:29.663
It was just a dream.

00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:34.311
No, it was a dream, yes, but there it was.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:38.090
He called me from youth camp.

00:20:38.713 --> 00:20:40.090
Youth camp?

00:20:42.295 --> 00:20:44.546
He contacted me from there for some reason.

00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:50.770
Let's get out of here. What is this?

00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:20.123
Alpine Lake Campground

00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:22.011
The camp where Mom called.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.955
We have to go there.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.189
Gwen, stop this.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.323
It was just a dream.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.594
About real places.

00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:31.500
The place I found.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:33.415
That's why I dream.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.594
It's a Christian youth camp near Silverthorne.

00:21:35.619 --> 00:21:36.730
What's this?

00:21:37.097 --> 00:21:40.272
They are opening CIT registration for the middle school winter camp.

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.751
What is CIT?

00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:43.948
Prospective mentor.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:53.574
I don't want to be a junior high school counselor or some weird Jesus camp from your dreams. No, you'll be a future counselor.

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.109
No, I don't want to.

00:21:55.134 --> 00:21:57.548
Come on, Dad has been telling you to find a job for a long time.

00:21:57.573 --> 00:21:59.126
And this is a paid job.

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:02.526
And we can find out what... I said no.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:05.500
What's going on here?

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.339
Hey, Ben wants us to work at a Christian camp.

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:14.297

00:22:16.786 --> 00:22:19.053
Your mother used to work there.

00:22:21.143 --> 00:22:22.339
When?

00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:26.229
Oh, long before I met him.

00:22:26.254 --> 00:22:28.984
It closed in 58.

00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:31.384
Where did you hear about this place?

00:22:31.409 --> 00:22:33.542
Eh, I... I haven't...

00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:37.938
The kids at school said it was a great way to make money.

00:22:40.154 --> 00:22:42.154
Christian camp, yes.

00:22:44.418 --> 00:22:50.024
You know I don't like religious things like that.

00:22:50.116 --> 00:22:51.849
It's just a job, Dad.

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:58.477
My mother used to work there.

00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:00.477
I'm not crazy.

00:23:02.219 --> 00:23:04.569
I never said you were crazy.

00:23:07.154 --> 00:23:10.554
Don't let me hear you drive a car over 55.

00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:12.000
Ya, Pak.

00:23:12.025 --> 00:23:14.299
I want my son back unharmed.

00:23:14.324 --> 00:23:15.559
You understand?

00:23:15.584 --> 00:23:17.183
Ya, Pak.

00:23:18.088 --> 00:23:19.819
What else did you say?

00:23:19.844 --> 00:23:21.135
Ya, Pak.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.735
I mean...

00:23:24.394 --> 00:23:28.357
I don't like the way he looks at me. Yeah, me too.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.180
Unlucky.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.000
Wait.

00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:34.631
Wait what?

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:47.059
Good.

00:23:47.084 --> 00:23:49.363
Take care of your sister.

00:23:50.801 --> 00:23:52.601
Please do something for me while I'm gone.

00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:54.286
Yes, anything, son.

00:23:55.358 --> 00:23:56.606
Don't get drunk.

00:23:58.129 --> 00:23:59.319
Come on.

00:23:59.344 --> 00:24:01.885
When do you believe I've stopped?

00:24:02.857 --> 00:24:05.502
In two weeks I'll get my three year chip.

00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:08.000
I'll show you when you get back.

00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:11.159
See you in a few weeks.

00:24:11.184 --> 00:24:13.088
Okay, good.

00:24:13.113 --> 00:24:16.256
Finally, there is peace in this house.

00:25:42.847 --> 00:25:44.723
I can't see the road

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:45.880
This is not safe.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.714
You could fall off a cliff and not see it.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.046
Stop the car.

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:56.754
What are you doing?

00:25:56.779 --> 00:25:59.811
I'll run in front of the car so I can see the road.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.785
Just follow me.

00:26:20.116 --> 00:26:21.604
Follow me!

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Command!

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.648
I found CIT lost!

00:26:43.355 --> 00:26:47.218
In front, about 20 yards, park anywhere.

00:26:52.119 --> 00:26:53.341
Thank You.

00:26:53.366 --> 00:26:54.497
You must be that kid.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.054
Yes, how did you know?

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:58.480
They closed a big bet on Silvercore.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:02.115
You're the only one who didn't get the news.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.880
I'm Armando, or Vando if you prefer.

00:27:04.905 --> 00:27:07.355
Come with me, let's go to the place.

00:27:09.677 --> 00:27:13.855
What about all the kids? Aren't they coming tomorrow?

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.115
Kids are cancelled.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.635
They won't be playing in the street until the storm passes.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.838
How many people got here?

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.734
Just the three of you.

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:26.546
The support staff has been here a week!

00:27:26.571 --> 00:27:28.788
If not, you're in luck!

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:32.924
Sorry to say, but for now you're stuck here!

00:27:44.333 --> 00:27:45.890
Ayo, Gwen!

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.690
You come with me!

00:27:49.508 --> 00:27:50.347
Here he is.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.018
Choose any bike.

00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:55.541
The Gators are ours, so give him a few minutes.

00:27:56.059 --> 00:27:58.355
We'll be warm soon.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.098
Good?

00:28:00.175 --> 00:28:01.415
Good night, children.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.698
Sweet dreams.

00:28:03.595 --> 00:28:05.195
I have to sleep here alone?

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.680
Unfortunately, state law requires separate premises.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.594
for teenage boys and girls.

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:10.935
I will stay here with you,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.514
but I'm not a registered coach,

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.235
so it can't be done.

00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:17.579
But my cabin is there

00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:19.278
if you need anything.

00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:22.234
Good night.

00:31:07.804 --> 00:31:09.804
Sorry, I can't help you.

00:31:36.095 --> 00:31:37.561
Who's this?

00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:27.933
Halo?

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:29.506
There are people?

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.026
Halo, Finney.

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:41.560
No!

00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:13.852
Hell is not fire, Finney.

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:18.385
It's ice.

00:33:28.752 --> 00:33:30.774
Nothing burned.

00:33:31.189 --> 00:33:33.264
..Like cold

00:33:40.422 --> 00:33:48.840
One more please. Come on. Hurry! Hurry!

00:33:51.476 --> 00:33:53.476
Gwen....Gwen

00:33:55.677 --> 00:33:57.435
Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.875
Hey, Gwen, Gwen! Look at me!

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.128
Hey, hey, look at me! Wake up! Wake up!

00:34:02.153 --> 00:34:03.554
Hello! Hello!

00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:06.294
What happened to me?

00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:08.655
Oh my God, I feel crazy.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.680
You're dreaming. You're fine.

00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:13.793
I feel crazy! You're okay.

00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:18.404
Are you alright.

00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:19.919
Are you alright.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.359
Are you alright.

00:34:54.289 --> 00:34:55.518
Gwen

00:34:58.689 --> 00:35:00.689
I had a nightmare.

00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:04.151
Okay, are you okay?

00:35:09.266 --> 00:35:11.811
Come here, lie down

00:35:33.874 --> 00:35:34.854
Oh God,

00:35:36.766 --> 00:35:39.277
Don't let me have nightmares again tonight.

00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:41.962
Please.

00:35:42.966 --> 00:35:44.225
Hey.

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:47.099
Are you alright?

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:51.352
Yes. Did I wake you?

00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:55.068
No.

00:35:56.263 --> 00:35:58.263
Is that real?

00:35:59.308 --> 00:36:00.511
What?

00:36:01.475 --> 00:36:05.724
You just talk to Jesus like that?

00:36:06.856 --> 00:36:09.975
Yeah. You think that's weird?

00:36:10.925 --> 00:36:13.556
No. Not at all.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.348
I think it's cool.

00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:21.498
You think it's cool that I'm talking to Jesus?

00:36:22.298 --> 00:36:27.835
Yeah. I mean, it might be even cooler if you called him Jesus.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.582
You know, my mother is Catholic.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.445
He must be happy that I'm dating someone who prays.

00:36:35.396 --> 00:36:37.078
Or dating.

00:36:37.807 --> 00:36:41.389
I mean, I just said that.

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:44.230
I'm a good Christian girl.

00:36:45.142 --> 00:36:47.867
Sure, why not?

00:36:51.311 --> 00:36:53.010
My mother is also Christian.

00:36:54.566 --> 00:36:59.966
My father didn't want us to be raised in church, but I asked a lot of questions.

00:37:01.506 --> 00:37:04.604
And when he wasn't there, Mom answered.

00:37:06.332 --> 00:37:09.238
Does he know about your dream?

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:13.119
I got that from him.

00:37:14.963 --> 00:37:16.866
It drives him crazy.

00:37:18.621 --> 00:37:21.302
I'm afraid the same thing will happen to me.

00:37:22.547 --> 00:37:24.000
Won't.

00:37:25.178 --> 00:37:27.525
You are too strong for that.

00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:36.703
Don't you think I'm weird?

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.170
What's wrong with being weird?

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:42.147
I'm weird like my mom.

00:37:43.235 --> 00:37:45.147
Are you close to him?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.075
Yes.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.425
I think about it every day.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.759
I can still see his face very clearly.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.846
She is beautiful.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.639
I think you are beautiful.

00:38:10.634 --> 00:38:13.039
What about me? Do you think I'm beautiful?

00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:17.945
Finn, you rotten piece of trash. Did you hear that?

00:38:20.452 --> 00:38:23.412
I'm still here, so it's not like I have a choice.

00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:30.992
I thought he was sleeping. I told you Duran Duran was on a date.

00:38:45.419 --> 00:38:48.653
Ernesto, I need to talk to Gwen alone.

00:38:48.852 --> 00:38:52.004
As for last night, he knows.

00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:53.400
What do you know?

00:38:53.656 --> 00:38:55.099
Why do you think he's here?

00:38:55.189 --> 00:38:57.179
He came to help us investigate.

00:38:57.204 --> 00:38:58.604
Wait, you told him about your dream?

00:38:59.936 --> 00:39:02.206
Yes, I know about the dream.

00:39:02.706 --> 00:39:05.189
And about the call you received.

00:39:06.002 --> 00:39:06.780
Gwen.

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:08.059
We can trust him.

00:39:08.084 --> 00:39:10.502
Okay, but that's not your right to say.

00:39:11.825 --> 00:39:13.185
Okay, I haven't told anyone yet.

00:39:13.305 --> 00:39:15.141
Because you don't have any friends.

00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:17.420
I have a friend.

00:39:17.445 --> 00:39:18.440
Name one.

00:39:18.465 --> 00:39:19.800
One that you once brought home to play with.

00:39:19.825 --> 00:39:22.519
One you mentioned in chat.

00:39:22.544 --> 00:39:24.800
Gwen, that's not your right to say.

00:39:24.825 --> 00:39:26.559
I have to tell someone, Finn.

00:39:26.584 --> 00:39:28.420
You never want to hear about my dreams.

00:39:28.445 --> 00:39:29.699
That is not true.

00:39:29.724 --> 00:39:30.860
Look at this?

00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:33.825
This happened last night, in my dream.

00:39:34.696 --> 00:39:36.515
I was surprised that the kids were pulling me.

00:39:38.805 --> 00:39:40.200
In your dreams?

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.420
Gwen, this is bad.

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:43.039
Good morning, kids!

00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:46.012
A beautiful day given by God at this camp.

00:39:46.037 --> 00:39:46.912
Come on, guys.

00:39:47.412 --> 00:39:49.075
Breakfast in the dining hall.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.641
Let's eat together.

00:40:05.266 --> 00:40:11.764
Where did you get that tattoo? In prison. But that was a long time ago.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.251
News says this is the worst snowstorm since 46

00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:24.510
Denver is closed. Two days at the earliest, maybe three. Could be longer.

00:40:24.553 --> 00:40:26.899
You've met my nephew, Mustang.

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:30.361
He works in the stables and kitchen with me.

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:32.649
Mustang, like the name of the car?

00:40:33.638 --> 00:40:34.826
Like a horse.

00:40:38.768 --> 00:40:40.753
How many other people are here?

00:40:40.778 --> 00:40:44.982
Only Kenneth and Barbara were in the office.

00:40:45.057 --> 00:40:51.878
The other staff had already left before the road closed. So, how did you guys sleep?

00:40:52.793 --> 00:40:53.834
Just fine.

00:40:56.069 --> 00:41:01.680
I saw you sleeping with a boy. I could lose my camp permit for that. Don't do it again.

00:41:02.763 --> 00:41:09.611
Now, the 64 thousand dollar question, why are you guys here?

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:14.000
To be a camp CIT.

00:41:14.974 --> 00:41:17.641
No, I understand that.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:24.809
I mean, none of you have ever been here as participants and none of you listed a church on the form.

00:41:24.834 --> 00:41:28.000
so that means you don't get our flyers.

00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:33.023
So, why are you guys here?

00:41:38.757 --> 00:41:40.473
So?

00:41:41.957 --> 00:41:44.375
Don't involve me in this, please.

00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:49.873
Our mother was here.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.608
Participant or builder? Builder.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.692
Her name is Hope Adler.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.427
Once?

00:41:58.643 --> 00:42:00.875
He died seven years ago.

00:42:01.049 --> 00:42:03.049
Hm. My condolences.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.679
Do you remember him?

00:42:06.613 --> 00:42:08.613
Many children come here.

00:42:10.502 --> 00:42:12.502
Do you know his nickname?

00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:19.014
Staff and coaches get nicknames. It's easier for kids to remember.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.895
Starlight.

00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:30.100
Are you Starlight's child?

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:32.700
So you remember him?

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:38.045
Very memorable. He is a true light.

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:44.623
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:42:47.708 --> 00:42:50.594
Can I ask how he died?

00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:54.662
He committed suicide.

00:42:59.328 --> 00:43:01.210
I am so sorry.

00:43:06.526 --> 00:43:07.435
Listen, I... .

00:43:09.404 --> 00:43:11.681
I'm glad you found us.

00:43:13.198 --> 00:43:17.059
After eating, you should call your family and let them know you are okay.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.383
There is a telephone in the camp office.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.250
Wait, what about the payphones outside?

00:43:23.995 --> 00:43:25.940
That's dead, son.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.295
Not working for over ten years.

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:37.640
The dead payphone rang last night.

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:39.588
Did you pick up?

00:43:40.525 --> 00:43:41.126
Yes.

00:43:42.185 --> 00:43:43.525
I'm sure it's him.

00:43:43.933 --> 00:43:45.141
So?

00:43:45.166 --> 00:43:47.712
You mean, him. Him.

00:43:47.737 --> 00:43:49.039
Oh my God.

00:43:49.064 --> 00:43:50.179
What did he say?

00:43:51.538 --> 00:43:53.657
What does he want?

00:43:56.152 --> 00:43:57.163
What?

00:43:57.188 --> 00:43:58.048
That rang again.

00:43:58.073 --> 00:44:01.104
Go call Dad. I'll catch up when I'm done.

00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:12.514
Do you want to say something?

00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:13.940
Then tell me.

00:44:15.162 --> 00:44:17.162
It's cold here

00:44:19.457 --> 00:44:20.695
Who's this?

00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:24.450
I don't remember

00:44:25.677 --> 00:44:27.114
What happened to you?

00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:28.894
We don't know

00:44:29.853 --> 00:44:31.706
You don't remember anything?

00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:33.500
There are three of us

00:44:33.817 --> 00:44:35.317
Okay, where are you guys?

00:44:36.405 --> 00:44:37.546
It's cold here

00:44:37.815 --> 00:44:39.015
Where is it cold?

00:44:41.096 --> 00:44:42.196
It's dark in here

00:44:44.279 --> 00:44:46.000
Tell me where you are.

00:44:46.483 --> 00:44:47.711
We don't know.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.387
My name is Finn.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.654
Help us, Finn.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.708
You should try to remember something.

00:44:57.299 --> 00:44:58.943
How did you die?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.727
We don't remember.

00:45:02.426 --> 00:45:03.983
We're scared, Finn.

00:45:04.416 --> 00:45:05.916
I understand.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.000
We shouldn't be here.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.500
What do you mean?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.500
This is not our place.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.500
We shouldn't be here.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.000
Something bad happened to you guys.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.502
Help us. Help us.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Say it.

00:45:25.665 --> 00:45:27.017
Tell me how I can help.

00:45:27.502 --> 00:45:31.326
Find us, please find us.

00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:35.493
Oh no! Yes, we're stuck in the snow here too.

00:45:52.858 --> 00:45:55.275
You just wait.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.891
I'm sure you'll be kicked out of there soon.

00:46:00.165 --> 00:46:01.239
I love you, son.

00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:04.718
Already...

00:46:08.216 --> 00:46:10.254
{\fs25}Go to the mountain

00:46:10.279 --> 00:46:12.279
{\fs25}Welcome back to KMGH news

00:46:12.304 --> 00:46:15.198
{\fs25}The storm paralyzed all areas

00:46:15.223 --> 00:46:18.633
{\fs25}Wind and snow made the roads impassable

00:46:18.658 --> 00:46:22.008
{\fs25Police from some cities even banned traffic

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.752
{\fs25}to the car

00:46:23.777 --> 00:46:27.855
{\fs25}The ban applies to all travel

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.554
Yeah, Jake, hey.

00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:32.554
Listen, I need help.

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:35.470
Has the company fleet finished clearing snow in the area?

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.099
Of course I will be careful.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.389
Good?

00:46:42.835 --> 00:46:43.915
I also love you.

00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:49.506
Excuse me

00:46:50.983 --> 00:46:52.983
Do you have any books about history?

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.723
we have flyers

00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:02.149
Damn. No more detailed notes?

00:47:03.123 --> 00:47:06.800
No. There is no official history of Camp Alpine Lake.

00:47:06.825 --> 00:47:09.853
We are a youth camp, not a historical society.

00:47:09.878 --> 00:47:12.363
Barbara, they are guests.

00:47:12.521 --> 00:47:18.568
No, Kenneth. This is the girl who snuck into the boys' cabin last night.

00:47:19.487 --> 00:47:22.159
So, what can we help you with, honey?

00:47:22.184 --> 00:47:29.400
We just want to know about the children who may have been killed here in the past.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.159
You don't need to know about that.

00:47:32.184 --> 00:47:33.699
We do not?

00:47:33.724 --> 00:47:34.923
No.

00:47:35.608 --> 00:47:40.054
Philippians 4:8 says we should think about beautiful things.

00:47:40.684 --> 00:47:44.618
Philippians 4:8 also says to think about things that are true, just, and honest.

00:47:44.643 --> 00:47:45.643
Right, Barb?

00:47:47.311 --> 00:47:50.286
Barbara. We don't know the details.

00:47:50.311 --> 00:47:56.860
This isn't a ghost tour or a seance camp. This is a Christian organization. We don't talk about that kind of stuff here.

00:47:57.397 --> 00:48:00.047
But something messed up did happen here, right?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Is your mouth always that dirty?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.860
Are you always so holy?

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.860
Hey, hey, you guys better go.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.013
Now.

00:48:12.702 --> 00:48:13.860
Okay.

00:48:15.495 --> 00:48:17.167
I will pray for you!

00:48:40.453 --> 00:48:41.630
Halo

00:48:42.726 --> 00:48:44.279
Who's this?

00:48:44.304 --> 00:48:45.470
Hope?

00:48:46.734 --> 00:48:48.000
Hope Adler?

00:48:48.223 --> 00:48:49.600
Who's this?

00:48:49.625 --> 00:48:51.360
I can't see you.

00:48:51.755 --> 00:48:52.993
Where are you?

00:48:53.018 --> 00:48:54.638
Alpine Lake.

00:48:56.785 --> 00:48:58.518
It's a youth camp in the mountains.

00:48:59.695 --> 00:49:01.411
So dark.

00:49:01.436 --> 00:49:03.436
Where did you find me?

00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:05.461
I had a dream.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.696
Seven digits.

00:49:09.296 --> 00:49:11.741
No area code, so it's a local call.

00:49:11.766 --> 00:49:13.607
You're in Colorado, right?

00:49:14.644 --> 00:49:16.644
Where are those numbers?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
The numbers are carved into the ice.

00:49:20.066 --> 00:49:22.935
Lake ice, huh?

00:49:23.338 --> 00:49:26.640
Yes It's very difficult to remember.

00:49:26.927 --> 00:49:28.838
It's so cold in the dark.

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.393
Who's this?

00:49:31.566 --> 00:49:33.052
Who are you?

00:49:33.689 --> 00:49:35.096
We all remember.

00:49:35.602 --> 00:49:37.030
Halo?

00:49:38.449 --> 00:49:40.130
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:49:43.155 --> 00:49:45.998
I shouldn't be here.

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:16.665
Ernesto, Wake Up!

00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:49.184
You don't have to pick up.

00:51:50.519 --> 00:51:51.939
Yes, it must.

00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.625
You have one task.

00:51:57.179 --> 00:51:59.091
Take care of my little brother.

00:52:00.234 --> 00:52:01.722
I promise. Hello, Cindy.

00:52:35.912 --> 00:52:37.667
Halo , Finney

00:52:41.031 --> 00:52:42.320
What do you want?

00:52:43.695 --> 00:52:48.355
It took a long time, but now I remember.

00:52:49.111 --> 00:52:50.323
You are dead.

00:52:51.244 --> 00:52:53.244
Oh, Finney.

00:52:54.558 --> 00:53:01.504
You know better that death is just a word.

00:53:05.619 --> 00:53:07.088
Tell me why you are here.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.222
Why do you think I'm here?

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.772
Because you knew we would get caught.

00:53:16.616 --> 00:53:17.772
Gwen?

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.599
Gwen?

00:53:20.659 --> 00:53:21.859
Gwen? Shut up! I don't know.

00:54:24.639 --> 00:54:29.373
You thought our story was over, Finney?

00:54:31.022 --> 00:54:36.702
You really believe you can do that to me and it's all over?

00:54:36.727 --> 00:54:38.295
I'm not afraid of you.

00:54:38.679 --> 00:54:40.262
And why should you be afraid?

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.945
You killed me.

00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:43.260
You win.

00:54:44.434 --> 00:54:45.735
Say what you want.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.280
What I always wanted from you.

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:52.443
What? You want to scare me?

00:54:55.189 --> 00:55:02.098
You know as well as I do that fear is just a warm-up.

00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:05.319
Gwen

00:55:06.819 --> 00:55:07.875
Gwen!

00:55:08.346 --> 00:55:09.710
Are you alright?

00:55:09.869 --> 00:55:10.968
What are you doing?

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:13.698
It's three in the morning!

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.258
Gwen is not in her dorm.

00:55:15.411 --> 00:55:16.550
I don't know where he is! Sorry.

00:55:52.527 --> 00:55:55.727
Have you guessed what it is?

00:55:56.126 --> 00:56:01.638
What I really want from you.

00:56:03.314 --> 00:56:07.647
Want isn't even the right word.

00:56:07.672 --> 00:56:12.189
More like an insatiable need.

00:56:13.056 --> 00:56:15.602
So you know?

00:56:16.232 --> 00:56:17.588
Not yet?

00:56:17.802 --> 00:56:19.143
Okay.

00:56:19.168 --> 00:56:21.061
I'll just say it, Finney.

00:56:22.088 --> 00:56:26.592
What I want is.

00:56:28.754 --> 00:56:38.082
I want to hurt you in ways you can't even imagine.

00:56:38.107 --> 00:56:46.371
You will pay for what you did to me. You made me kill my brother!

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:52.397
The person I love most in the world!

00:56:52.853 --> 00:56:55.745
Then you kill me!

00:56:56.909 --> 00:57:01.717
So now I'm going to destroy you, Finney.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.962
By destroying the things you love most.

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:14.050
Vengeance is mine.

00:57:50.176 --> 00:57:52.785
Gwenn

00:58:19.777 --> 00:58:21.063
Help me!

00:59:02.422 --> 00:59:03.335
Hey, Gwenn!

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.639
Gwenn, wake up!

00:59:04.664 --> 00:59:05.863
Gwenn, wake up!!

00:59:06.452 --> 00:59:10.474
Gwenn, are you awake? Gwenn, are you awake?

00:59:18.357 --> 00:59:19.875
Are you awake?

00:59:23.607 --> 00:59:26.607
There's a devil in you, son.

00:59:45.892 --> 00:59:53.314
I've lived in this world for a long time. Seen many things I can't explain.

00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:57.073
I've never heard of anyone having a dream like the one you described.

00:59:57.847 --> 00:59:59.407
Where do you think it came from?

00:59:59.432 --> 01:00:00.614
He is possessed.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.914
Oh my God, Mando, isn't it obvious?

01:00:03.206 --> 01:00:06.702
I'm not possessed, you disgusting bitch.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.211
You think this is funny, Mustang?

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.661
You got your horns cut?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.255
Yes indeed.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.340
Just mind your business.

01:00:14.365 --> 01:00:17.906
Why are you acting like this is the first time you've seen something scary here?

01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:18.491
Stop it.

01:00:18.762 --> 01:00:23.102
We've all seen or heard things here.

01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:24.400
Including you, Barb.

01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:26.782
Barbara. Shut up, both of you!

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:34.779
Gwen, your dream, do you mean it shows the future?

01:00:35.857 --> 01:00:40.434
Sometimes the dead show things from the past.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.188
Something like what? Like the youngest lost child.

01:00:46.159 --> 01:00:47.465
Felix?

01:00:48.159 --> 01:00:51.373
He ran for his life wearing a yellow parka jacket.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:55.000
And the tallest child, he was wearing a white parka.

01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:56.172
Spike.

01:00:56.661 --> 01:01:01.000
And scratched letters on the ice. WB H.

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:05.396
I think his head was split open at the base of a tree in the forest.

01:01:05.421 --> 01:01:06.888
Oh God, no.

01:01:07.132 --> 01:01:09.413
The third child is wearing a denim jacket.

01:01:09.438 --> 01:01:11.000
He was burnt to death.

01:01:11.975 --> 01:01:14.257
Like cooked in the oven.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:17.719
How do you know that? _____Mando

01:01:17.744 --> 01:01:18.955
Oh no, no.

01:01:19.653 --> 01:01:23.783
Gwen, ignore everyone in the room.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:28.694
It's just you and me now. The burning child

01:01:28.872 --> 01:01:30.605
How do you know about that?

01:01:31.179 --> 01:01:32.937
I told you so

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.004
He came to me in a dream

01:01:35.981 --> 01:01:38.793
He wanted me to find him They all do

01:01:38.818 --> 01:01:41.415
They can't rest until they are found.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.526
Are you okay, Mondo?

01:01:42.551 --> 01:01:43.357
World?

01:01:43.382 --> 01:01:43.988
Hah

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:50.779
Caldina Caves' burnt denim jacket cutout

01:01:51.004 --> 01:01:55.068
found by the police. Only they know those details.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.748
The police, the former camp owner, and me.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.815
What about what we saw in the kitchen? It wasn't a dream.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.097
You've heard of Grabber,

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:12.114
Yes, who killed many children and one of them escaped,

01:02:12.139 --> 01:02:15.292
yeah, his name is Finney, what's that...?

01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:20.804
Finney Blake

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:23.938
Finney Blake

01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:27.138
Good grief.

01:02:28.691 --> 01:02:29.876
Gwenn?

01:02:30.387 --> 01:02:32.219
When did all this start?

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:35.134
A few weeks ago when my mother called me from this camp in a dream.

01:02:35.846 --> 01:02:37.377
He wanted me to come here.

01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:40.719
What does this have to do with Grabber?

01:02:40.744 --> 01:02:42.800
It wasn't a demon that attacked me in the kitchen.

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:43.780
There he is.

01:02:43.805 --> 01:02:44.975
I can see it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.499
He's here. This is from Canaan's last year before it closed.

01:02:50.054 --> 01:02:57.000
At that time, I was just the camp cook. That was me. And that was your mother.

01:02:58.089 --> 01:03:04.191
After Harlem, the owner, closed this place, I still came here.

01:03:04.216 --> 01:03:08.267
Wandering this area looking for those children

01:03:09.132 --> 01:03:13.943
Then when Harlan died I bought this place at a cheap auction and opened it again.

01:03:14.209 --> 01:03:17.784
I promised their parents I wouldn't stop looking until I found them.

01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:26.606
So every day, weather permitting, I keep walking the trail, digging up every mound of dirt.

01:03:26.724 --> 01:03:31.112
There's not a morning that goes by that I don't pray that I can find those children.

01:03:31.924 --> 01:03:34.286
I didn't know it was you he sent.

01:03:35.659 --> 01:03:42.994
But now that you're here, I won't waste the opportunity to calm the kids down.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:46.140
For them, their families, and for me.

01:03:47.649 --> 01:03:48.729
Impossible.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.630
What's wrong with this family?

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.119
There he is.

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:53.719
Tuan Grabber.

01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:56.386
Are you sure? I know him, and I know his face.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.002
That's Bill.

01:03:59.239 --> 01:04:02.413
Wild Bill. He wears Mendon's.

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:10.886
We called him Wild Bill because he wore a loose brown leather belt around his waist like a gun-toting cowboy,

01:04:10.911 --> 01:04:14.911
and his hair was long and wavy like Wild Bill Hickok.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.566
Wild Bill Hickok. WBH.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:24.600
This is where he started. The children were his first victims.

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:26.291
Wild Bill becomes Grabber.

01:04:26.358 --> 01:04:29.704
Mondo, when did weird things start happening here?

01:04:30.035 --> 01:04:32.274
Just a few years ago.

01:04:32.365 --> 01:04:33.854
1978?

01:04:34.608 --> 01:04:37.114
It seems true. I saw it. I killed it.

01:04:37.376 --> 01:04:39.376
And his spirit is free to return here.

01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:41.734
Okay, but why did he do that?

01:04:42.738 --> 01:04:45.656
Perhaps his spirit draws strength from the fear of his victims.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.280
because their spirits are not yet at peace.

01:04:48.534 --> 01:04:50.856
How do we find the kids?

01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:55.046
Their bodies are underwater, in a frozen lake.

01:04:55.238 --> 01:04:57.132
But didn't the police check the surrounding lakes?

01:04:57.179 --> 01:04:58.514
No, why should I?

01:04:58.539 --> 01:05:01.150
The lakes froze when the children went missing.

01:05:02.323 --> 01:05:05.263
we fished at lake maru in winter

01:05:05.288 --> 01:05:11.088
so we keep the equipment there. That's why Bill wears it to hockey games.

01:05:11.113 --> 01:05:19.865
He was a good skater. That's the lake where he dug a hole in the ice and drowned himself.

01:05:20.452 --> 01:05:27.352
So if we find Felix, Cal, and Spike, let them rest in peace, like you said,

01:05:27.377 --> 01:05:29.547
will that remove Grabber's powers?

01:05:31.816 --> 01:05:33.696
I think so. Yes.

01:05:35.718 --> 01:05:36.843
Okay.

01:05:37.149 --> 01:05:41.852
At dawn, we went to Lake Maru and looked for the children.

01:06:16.819 --> 01:06:18.954
Very cute, Mustang.

01:06:31.984 --> 01:06:35.695
See what I'm going to do

01:06:36.717 --> 01:06:39.851
You made me, kill my brother

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:48.136
I know you're out there, Bill.

01:06:49.491 --> 01:06:51.931
You can't have those kids forever.

01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:58.266
My name is not Bill.

01:06:59.361 --> 01:07:00.702
Wild Bill.

01:07:01.616 --> 01:07:03.157
Grabber.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.783
Evil is still evil.

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:46.945
I want to kill you.

01:07:52.288 --> 01:07:59.483
We'll get those kids back, Bill. My name isn't Bill!

01:08:26.697 --> 01:08:31.464
It is not permitted in the Alpine Camping area.

01:08:34.098 --> 01:08:36.298
So fire me.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:47.488
You've been through a lot, haven't you, son?

01:08:54.477 --> 01:08:58.610
There was a certain look in a young man's eyes.

01:08:59.646 --> 01:09:09.148
A kind of anger, revenge because I have seen and experienced so much.

01:09:14.265 --> 01:09:17.069
Do you fight often, Finn?

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:20.702
So?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.264
So, this is what I know.

01:09:24.724 --> 01:09:28.964
Behind anger, there is fear.

01:09:30.798 --> 01:09:32.439
I'm not afraid of anything.

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.500
I know one thing you're afraid of.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.500
Yes?

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500
What's that?

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.293
You couldn't protect your sister.

01:09:43.593 --> 01:09:48.359
When I was on the street, I chose the wrong path.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.825
Instead of facing my fears, I chose anger.

01:09:52.225 --> 01:09:55.558
You do the same thing, I can see it.

01:09:56.239 --> 01:10:01.119
Son, this is my daily job.

01:10:01.119 --> 01:10:08.945
Every year I meet half a dozen kids like you. Kids who were told they had to be like this.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.408
You are stronger than you think.

01:10:15.566 --> 01:10:17.566
You are strong enough to kill the Grabber,

01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:20.591
and you are strong enough to let go of what happened to him.

01:10:26.066 --> 01:10:28.333
I don't know how to do it.

01:10:29.166 --> 01:10:33.133
You have to face your feelings..

01:10:34.589 --> 01:10:40.389
Don't bury it and freeze it. You have to face it and let it go.

01:10:42.205 --> 01:10:48.714
He wants to kill Gwen. Hurt me. Oh, we won't let that happen.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.341
I brought this.

01:11:01.366 --> 01:11:03.366
Come on, I need that.

01:11:03.391 --> 01:11:06.391
Please. That's not good either.

01:11:06.782 --> 01:11:09.091
We'll be at the lake in an hour.

01:11:09.116 --> 01:11:11.841
At dawn. Get ready

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:16.858
Ernesto and I will take turns looking after you, so...

01:12:17.579 --> 01:12:19.819
If you have another nightmare, we'll wake you up.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.646
What if you can't?

01:12:25.366 --> 01:12:27.027
So fight.

01:12:28.127 --> 01:12:30.000
I mean, that's your dream, right?

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.365
He is more than that.

01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:42.408
What books have you read about dreams?

01:12:42.433 --> 01:12:44.585
There's bound to be something you can try.

01:12:45.433 --> 01:12:48.181
He is too strong.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:55.415
I used to think so too.

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.863
He's sleeping. Can I ask you something?

01:13:11.239 --> 01:13:14.410
Did you really talk to my brother in that basement?

01:13:27.527 --> 01:13:28.727
Yes.

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:30.727
Yes, right.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.000
What did he say?

01:13:33.265 --> 01:13:38.731
He said your father didn't come home from Vietnam because he couldn't leave his friends.

01:13:39.955 --> 01:13:42.097
And he will not leave me.

01:13:42.608 --> 01:13:43.508
Yes.

01:13:45.193 --> 01:13:48.165
Yes, like Robin Hood.

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.608
Do you think he's still here?

01:13:55.819 --> 01:13:58.508
I don't know what's on the other side.

01:13:59.932 --> 01:14:01.574
But there is something.

01:14:02.712 --> 01:14:04.274
And I hope it's good.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.541
I wish he was there.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.141
But if not...

01:14:10.699 --> 01:14:12.975
I'm not the one he's taking care of here.

01:14:16.306 --> 01:14:18.500
Wake me up in four hours.

01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:21.666
Wild Bill

01:15:48.014 --> 01:15:52.248
You stay in bed tonight. .

01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:52.855
You look like your mother

01:18:56.352 --> 01:18:58.389
Why is he here?

01:18:59.889 --> 01:19:01.758
A kindness, actually.

01:19:02.717 --> 01:19:05.356
A favor for you.

01:19:07.938 --> 01:19:09.860
Goodness?

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:12.427
That's what I can imagine.

01:19:15.845 --> 01:19:18.764
My mother had a dream about Billy Showalter.

01:19:19.132 --> 01:19:20.931
Newspaper delivery boy.

01:19:21.126 --> 01:19:23.731
He was the first child to be kidnapped in our area.

01:19:24.613 --> 01:19:28.054
He knows you kidnapped him, right?

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.154
Isn't it obvious?

01:19:34.131 --> 01:19:39.098
The kindness I gave you, to show you the truth

01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:42.714
before I do what I have to do.

01:19:57.499 --> 01:20:03.458
Abandon all hope, you who enter here.

01:20:15.595 --> 01:20:19.062
He didn't commit suicide.

01:20:21.533 --> 01:20:24.243
You killed him!

01:20:34.548 --> 01:20:38.983
What are you doing

01:20:42.658 --> 01:20:45.191
Actually it wasn't a dream

01:20:45.939 --> 01:20:52.358
I summon this from my hatred and the memories I harbor.

01:20:52.966 --> 01:20:57.600
Hell is different than you think.

01:20:57.866 --> 01:21:00.400
They take the best part of you,

01:21:00.659 --> 01:21:02.714
your human part,

01:21:02.739 --> 01:21:05.695
and only leave the worst parts,

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.685
Only sin.

01:21:08.039 --> 01:21:12.739
I am a bottomless pit of sin.

01:21:15.033 --> 01:21:17.033
What do you think happened?

01:21:17.165 --> 01:21:19.604
when you die in this world?

01:21:21.633 --> 01:21:23.093
I will wake up.

01:21:23.819 --> 01:21:24.952
Maybe.

01:21:25.699 --> 01:21:28.652
Or maybe

01:21:28.725 --> 01:21:30.660
you are really dead.

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.241
It's time to find out.

01:21:54.864 --> 01:21:56.094
Halo

01:21:56.119 --> 01:21:58.197
You have to hide.

01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:46.975
Gwen! Gwen! Wake up! Gwen! Gwen wake up!

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.341
Finn! Mustang!

01:22:49.366 --> 01:22:50.366
Gwen!

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:52.818
What's wrong with him?

01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:10.910
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:37.877 --> 01:23:39.439
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:39.439 --> 01:23:40.439
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:40.439 --> 01:23:41.439
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:41.439 --> 01:23:42.439
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:42.439 --> 01:23:43.439
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:43.439 --> 01:23:44.439
Gwen, wake up!

01:23:59.589 --> 01:24:02.899
You're naughty, Gwen.

01:24:04.089 --> 01:24:06.199
Screw you.

01:24:06.955 --> 01:24:10.548
A spicy tongue for a girl as young as you.

01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:13.300
What are you doing?

01:24:13.485 --> 01:24:22.905
If anyone tries to take my power, I have the right to defend myself.

01:24:24.112 --> 01:24:25.732
Command. ...

01:24:30.241 --> 01:24:32.808
Tell the kids they miss him.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
World!

01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:54.562
Gwen, Wake Up!

01:25:18.895 --> 01:25:19.977
Gwenn

01:25:34.948 --> 01:25:35.589
Gwenn!

01:25:35.614 --> 01:25:37.811
Press the wound. Okay.

01:25:37.836 --> 01:25:39.300
Okay, help me turn it over.

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:41.478
Gwenn.

01:25:42.656 --> 01:25:44.020
Gwenn, wake up.

01:25:44.045 --> 01:25:44.767
Gwenn?

01:25:46.634 --> 01:25:47.800
Gwenn?

01:25:47.825 --> 01:25:49.674
Okay. Gwenn, can you hear us?

01:25:49.699 --> 01:25:50.879
Quinn, wake up!

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.300
Quinn, wake up!

01:25:52.325 --> 01:25:53.300
Wake up and keep pressing on the wound.

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.100
Got it, Gwenn.

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.000
You have to wake up.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:55.699
You have to wake up!

01:25:55.699 --> 01:25:56.800
Come on, we need help!

01:25:56.899 --> 01:25:59.409
Gwenn, if you can hear me, you must fight!

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500
Gwenn, lawan!

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:27.030
You didn't bring me here. I came on my own.

01:26:27.119 --> 01:26:31.585
I chose to come. And I can leave whenever I want.

01:26:32.184 --> 01:26:37.619
Now I understand. In dreams, I have powers too.

01:26:37.644 --> 01:26:38.880
So?

01:26:41.925 --> 01:26:45.659
What are you doing? Isn't it obvious?

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:49.792
I'm against you, rotten, disgusting.

01:26:54.246 --> 01:26:56.934
See you later, Wild Bill.

01:27:02.619 --> 01:27:04.150
World?

01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:05.795
World!

01:27:16.456 --> 01:27:17.856
Is he dead?

01:27:21.406 --> 01:27:22.673
I found Felix.

01:27:24.174 --> 01:27:25.435
I found it.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.338
I found Felix.

01:27:38.075 --> 01:27:40.439
Mustang, what time is it?

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:41.594
Around 4.30.

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:43.002
What happened? Are you okay?

01:27:43.027 --> 01:27:43.928
Yes, I'm fine.

01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:46.259
Mondo fell through the ice on Lake Maru.

01:27:46.284 --> 01:27:47.000
Oh no.

01:27:47.382 --> 01:27:48.604
He is fine.

01:27:48.693 --> 01:27:52.000
But he found one of the missing children in the water.

01:27:53.182 --> 01:27:55.964
We will all start looking for the other two at dawn.

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:57.375
We need your help.

01:27:58.076 --> 01:28:01.099
Not with that devil child outside.

01:28:01.523 --> 01:28:02.945
Her name is Gwen.

01:28:03.539 --> 01:28:05.619
And he's the reason we got to Mondo on time.

01:28:06.279 --> 01:28:07.670
That devil's child?

01:28:07.979 --> 01:28:09.020
He saved her life.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.180
I don't know, maybe.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:16.557
You know, if you want to be a coward and hide in this room until it's safe, go ahead.

01:28:17.674 --> 01:28:20.064
But that is not true Christian behavior.

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.680
The sun rises at seven o'clock.

01:28:54.354 --> 01:28:55.174
There he is.

01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:56.097
Are you alright?

01:29:11.098 --> 01:29:13.432
Dad? Hey, son.

01:29:13.483 --> 01:29:14.832
What are you doing here?

01:29:15.899 --> 01:29:19.127
You're stuck in the snow, so I'm asking for help.

01:29:19.239 --> 01:29:20.372
I'm grateful.

01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:22.239
Finally we can get out of here.

01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.727
We have to stay.

01:29:24.575 --> 01:29:25.682
What?

01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:28.083
We have to stay.

01:29:30.755 --> 01:29:32.239
What is it?

01:29:32.466 --> 01:29:34.239
Our work here is not finished.

01:29:34.377 --> 01:29:36.239
He's after her, Dad.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.909
He... Who is he?

01:29:39.794 --> 01:29:40.709
Yes.

01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:47.470
I don't know.

01:29:48.315 --> 01:29:50.355
Gwen, uh...

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:55.453
Is this about dreams again? Well, no.

01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.979
Okay, let's get out of here.

01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:01.140
Let's go.

01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.520
I took my stuff.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.640
I'm not going.

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.640
Gwen, he will kill you.

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.182
Okay, and I can't stop him.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:12.670
But we have a chance.

01:30:12.819 --> 01:30:14.460
A chance to protect you, keep you safe.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.134
You're going to take care of me, Finn?

01:30:16.336 --> 01:30:18.689
You can't even take care of yourself.

01:30:18.835 --> 01:30:20.782
You are just like Dad.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.399
Burying your head in the sand and numbing yourself until it disappears.

01:30:23.437 --> 01:30:26.264
Wow! Where did that come from?

01:30:26.312 --> 01:30:30.140
You've seen what he's doing, pretend not to know, pretend not to smell it

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:34.699
in his room, in the backyard. You can't pretend you don't know

01:30:34.699 --> 01:30:38.882
You just pretend none of this ever happened.

01:30:38.907 --> 01:30:43.147
It happened to those kids, and it's happening now,

01:30:43.348 --> 01:30:45.000
but you two ran and hid as usual.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Silence.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Bottles, rolls,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Silence.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Anything to stop the pain.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Silence.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.975
so that what happens in the basement is real

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Shut up!

01:30:55.639 --> 01:30:58.039
You think I don't know it's real?

01:30:59.461 --> 01:31:02.616
You think I don't know it's real?

01:31:04.327 --> 01:31:06.438
That's what I always think.

01:31:07.819 --> 01:31:10.914
You don't know what it's like there.

01:31:10.939 --> 01:31:12.829
No one knows.

01:31:15.602 --> 01:31:20.838
I was so scared.

01:31:28.133 --> 01:31:30.753
God, I don't want to be angry anymore.

01:31:47.056 --> 01:31:49.056
I don't want to be afraid.

01:31:53.855 --> 01:31:54.900
Hey.

01:31:58.665 --> 01:32:00.988
You are the bravest person I know.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:11.800
Okay. Look at me. Please, I know you want to stay.

01:32:12.022 --> 01:32:14.710
I know, but if you are in danger here

01:32:14.757 --> 01:32:15.865
We have to go

01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:17.132
Right now

01:32:17.174 --> 01:32:18.155
No

01:32:19.687 --> 01:32:21.607
Honey, sorry.

01:32:21.918 --> 01:32:23.541
But I'm not asking for permission

01:32:23.576 --> 01:32:24.797
What are you going to do, Dad?

01:32:25.119 --> 01:32:26.313
You want to hit me?

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.321
Take off my belt and drag me to the truck?

01:32:28.366 --> 01:32:30.075
Don't. Please try.

01:32:30.233 --> 01:32:31.410
See if it works.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.015
Your mother, there. That's your mother. You're just like your mother.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:35.895
Stubborn.

01:32:36.055 --> 01:32:37.214
You are so stubborn.

01:32:37.239 --> 01:32:39.539
Until the end, even in the face of reality.

01:32:39.564 --> 01:32:41.632
End?

01:32:41.779 --> 01:32:43.832
Let me tell you about the ending, Dad.

01:32:44.155 --> 01:32:46.298
Mom didn't commit suicide.

01:32:49.134 --> 01:32:53.601
Okay, enough. Let's all get in... No, Gwenn?

01:32:54.708 --> 01:32:56.067
What do you mean?

01:32:57.626 --> 01:32:58.775
Mother's Dream.

01:32:59.856 --> 01:33:02.276
He dreamed about the missing child, didn't he?

01:33:02.919 --> 01:33:04.858
Talk about the camp before he died.

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:06.880
That's why you remember camp.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.500
Yeah, but, yeah, so?

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.600
He found it long before he took Finn,

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.939
and he saw it, so he came to our house.

01:33:16.699 --> 01:33:17.520
No.

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:20.349
Good grief.

01:33:21.654 --> 01:33:23.668
He showed me he was the one who killed him.

01:33:25.073 --> 01:33:28.473
Well, what's the first thing you said when you saw Mom?

01:33:30.023 --> 01:33:30.889
What?

01:33:30.978 --> 01:33:34.245
You ask him, what are you doing?

01:33:34.423 --> 01:33:36.119
What are you doing?

01:33:36.392 --> 01:33:38.508
And you blame yourself.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.038
You say, what have I done?

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.840
We were sleeping when it happened.

01:33:46.866 --> 01:33:48.760
And you found it.

01:33:48.949 --> 01:33:51.420
How else can I say it?

01:33:51.749 --> 01:33:53.638
It's not your fault, Dad.

01:33:54.119 --> 01:33:55.808
Oh my God.

01:33:56.786 --> 01:33:58.100
And it's not his fault either.

01:33:58.125 --> 01:33:59.500
Oh my God.

01:33:59.525 --> 01:34:03.091
The person who kidnapped Finn also took from us.

01:34:03.788 --> 01:34:05.780
Because he almost broke it.

01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:09.985
Because his dream was not just a dream.

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.758
So is my dream.

01:34:30.457 --> 01:34:32.013
Give me the cable

01:34:43.786 --> 01:34:45.631
You know, Jesus

01:34:47.055 --> 01:34:48.434
I'm not okay.

01:34:49.964 --> 01:34:51.439
I need help.

01:34:51.685 --> 01:34:53.484
Real help.

01:34:55.066 --> 01:34:59.762
We have to find two other children to take away their powers.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.539
I'm afraid he will kill me.

01:35:03.695 --> 01:35:05.293
This time it's real.

01:35:06.473 --> 01:35:11.748
Please don't let that happen. Save us alive.

01:35:11.773 --> 01:35:13.075
Don't let him win.

01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:17.582
We don't see anything.

01:35:18.923 --> 01:35:25.662
Maybe he was too far down. I thought so too. We should have seen it.

01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:46.832
Hey, calm down, son.

01:35:47.406 --> 01:35:49.406
You've had enough today.

01:36:03.484 --> 01:36:04.906
Oh, no, Gwen.

01:36:06.027 --> 01:36:07.006
Gwen!

01:36:07.516 --> 01:36:09.027
Gwen, wake up!

01:36:09.494 --> 01:36:11.361
We need help!

01:36:21.993 --> 01:36:23.300
Hei, Gwen.

01:36:23.405 --> 01:36:25.039
Gwen, wake up!

01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:26.845
He fell asleep.

01:36:27.999 --> 01:36:29.134
Accidentally

01:37:17.564 --> 01:37:18.920
He is here

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.941
Unlucky

01:37:54.799 --> 01:37:56.265
Oh my God!

01:38:05.768 --> 01:38:07.161
He's still here!

01:38:08.083 --> 01:38:10.130
Where did he go?

01:38:10.909 --> 01:38:12.531
The ice is broken!

01:38:15.557 --> 01:38:16.883
Cable!

01:38:36.312 --> 01:38:38.068
Finn

01:38:44.855 --> 01:38:47.876
Incredible change.

01:38:51.454 --> 01:38:54.477
Ernesto is leaving here

01:39:04.624 --> 01:39:06.861
I remember the taste.

01:39:07.439 --> 01:39:09.894
Congestion. Fear.

01:39:09.919 --> 01:39:13.620
The whole world is starting to fade away.

01:39:24.881 --> 01:39:26.881
Did you get him?

01:39:57.074 --> 01:40:00.325
grave, your victory?

01:40:01.025 --> 01:40:04.103
death, stings you

01:40:09.399 --> 01:40:11.199
Kitab suci

01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:17.166
God is not here. You are alone.

01:40:18.899 --> 01:40:22.098
No, I brought a friend. Sorry. The children have been found.

01:41:15.364 --> 01:41:17.227
The children have been found.

01:41:17.252 --> 01:41:19.298
You are helpless.

01:41:45.316 --> 01:41:48.116
You are truly finished.

01:41:48.413 --> 01:41:51.516
Hell is fire, Bill.

01:41:51.541 --> 01:41:52.766
It's ice.

01:41:55.483 --> 01:41:57.483
Ah! Thank you. Hey, are you okay? Are you okay? You're great, Dad.

01:42:02.125 --> 01:42:04.125
You don't scare me.

01:43:21.198 --> 01:43:23.898
Hey, are you okay?

01:43:39.026 --> 01:43:40.677
Great, Yah.

01:43:45.342 --> 01:43:47.774
It's done. He's gone.

01:43:48.674 --> 01:43:50.285
Where is he going?

01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:53.310
The children took it to its proper place.

01:44:03.095 --> 01:44:07.927
Hello, this is Armando Reyes from Alpine Lake.

01:44:09.479 --> 01:44:10.760
Yes.

01:44:10.899 --> 01:44:12.395
Okay, okay, yeah.

01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.114
I know, it's been a while.

01:44:15.819 --> 01:44:17.848
The reason I'm calling is

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.079
I have news about Calvin.

01:44:22.899 --> 01:44:24.748
Yes.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.714
Yes, we finally found it.

01:44:39.552 --> 01:44:41.085
What?

01:44:42.738 --> 01:44:44.160
Did you hear that?

01:44:45.825 --> 01:44:46.560
No.

01:44:46.585 --> 01:44:48.093
The phone rings.

01:44:52.733 --> 01:44:55.027
It must be for you.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.960
Halo?

01:45:17.632 --> 01:45:19.775
Hi darling.

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.304
Mother?

01:45:26.329 --> 01:45:27.504
Yes, Son.

01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:31.850
I don't have much time, but here I am.

01:45:34.437 --> 01:45:36.437
Where are you?

01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:39.304
You know where.

01:45:39.329 --> 01:45:41.104
It's so beautiful here.

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:45.237
Is it true?.

01:45:45.661 --> 01:45:51.661
Yes, very beautiful. Just like you.

01:45:55.267 --> 01:46:03.123
I miss you, Mom. I miss you too, Honey.

01:46:03.148 --> 01:46:04.681
You have done well.

01:46:04.706 --> 01:46:07.556
You saved the children.

01:46:09.407 --> 01:46:11.341
I didn't save anyone.

01:46:11.366 --> 01:46:12.407
Yes, you saved.

01:46:13.783 --> 01:46:15.116
You set them free.

01:46:15.141 --> 01:46:17.285
They are now where they should be.

01:46:18.277 --> 01:46:19.154
Wait.

01:46:20.509 --> 01:46:22.308
I have to ask something.

01:46:23.783 --> 01:46:26.243
Ask anything.

01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:34.325
Will I always be cursed?

01:46:39.333 --> 01:46:41.599
That's not a curse, honey.

01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:45.233
It was never a curse.

01:46:48.732 --> 01:46:50.233
Mom has to go.

01:46:51.449 --> 01:46:53.837
Tell your brother I love him.

01:46:55.133 --> 01:46:57.504
And say hello to Robinson

01:48:05.456 --> 01:48:06.789
Son

01:48:07.967 --> 01:48:09.159
Time to go.

01:48:09.184 --> 01:48:10.500
Let's go

01:48:22.205 --> 01:48:25.519
So what do you think about Ernesto?

01:48:25.544 --> 01:48:27.908
He could have had worse.

01:48:28.239 --> 01:48:29.365
How about you?

01:48:29.646 --> 01:48:30.355
Hah?

01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:33.279
Mustang is pretty sweet in my opinion.

01:48:33.478 --> 01:48:35.389
Well, please, just drive.

01:48:36.954 --> 01:48:38.075
Just saying.

01:48:38.947 --> 01:48:39.947
Be careful on the way.

01:48:41.568 --> 01:48:42.768
Just saying.
